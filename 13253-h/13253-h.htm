    <h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

    <p>The iceberg was moving. There was no doubt of it. Moving
    with a terrible sinuous motion. Occasionally an incautious
    ironclad approached like a foolish hen, and pecked at the
    moving mass. Then there was a slight crash, followed by a mild
    convulsion of masts, and spars, and iron-plates, and 100-ton
    guns, then two or three gurgles and all was still. The iceberg
    passed on smiling in triumph, and British Admirals wrote to the
    <i>Times</i> to declare that they had known from the first that
    H.M.S. <i>Thunderbomb</i> had been so faultily constructed, as
    to make a contest with a hen-coop a certainty for the
    hen-coop.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/85.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/85.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>And still the iceberg was moving. Within its central chamber
    sat a venerable man, lightly clad in nankeen breeches, a cap of
    liberty, and a Liberty silk shirt. He was writing
    cabalistically. He did not know why, nor did he know what
    "cabalistically" meant. This was his punishment. Why was he to
    be punished? Those who read shall hear. The walls of the
    chamber were fitted with tubes, and electric wires, and knobs
    and buttons. A bright fire burned on the hearth. The thick
    Brussels carpet was littered with pot-boilers, all fizzing, and
    sputtering, and steaming, like so many young Curates at a Penny
    Reading. Suddenly the Philosopher looked up. He spoke to
    himself. "Everything is ready," he said, and pressed a button
    by his side. There was a sound as of a Continent expectorating,
    a distant nose seemed to twang, the door opened, and a tall
    lantern-jawed gentleman, wearing a goat-beard and an expression
    of dauntless cunning, stepped into the room.</p>

    <p>"I guess you were waiting round for me," said Colonel
    ZEDEKIAH D. GOBANG (for it was indeed he), and sat down in an
    empty armchair, as if nothing had happened.</p>

    <p>The Philosopher appeared not to notice. "Next character,
    please," he said, pulling out a long stop, and placing his
    square leg on the wicket which gave admission to his
    laboratory, while he waited for the entrance of the Third Man.
    There came a murmur like the buzz of a ton of blasting powder,
    in a state of excitement. A choir of angels seemed to whisper
    "Beefsteak and Pale Ale," as Lord JOHN BULLPUP dashed, without
    a trace of emotion, into the room, and sneezed three times
    without stopping to wipe his boots on the mat.</p>

    <p>"One more," said the Philosopher. He hurled himself, feet
    first, at the ceiling, knocked his head against the floor, and
    called down the tube. "<i>J'y suis!</i>" came the answer, and
    the typical, light-hearted Frenchman, M. le Docteur REVERSI,
    with his thousand thunders, and his blue lower chest, tripped
    jauntily up to the other three. "And now," remarked the
    Philosopher, "we have got the lot complete. The story can
    start. Hurry up! Hark forrard! <i>En avant!</i>"</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <p>"Lend me your ears," said the Philosopher. They lent them,
    but without interest. Yet they were all keen business men.
    "Attention, my friends!" he continued, somewhat annoyed. "You
    know why I have summoned you. We have to make another journey
    together. The moon, the sea, the earth&mdash;we have voyaged
    and journeyed to them, and they are exhausted. It remains to
    visit the Sun, and to perform the journey in an iceberg. Do you
    see? Colonel GOBANG will supply the craft, Lord JOHN BULLPUP
    the stupid courage, and you, M. le Docteur," he added,
    admiringly, "will of course take the cake."</p>

    <p>He paused, and waited for Lord JOHN's reply. It came prompt,
    and in the expected words.</p>

    <p>"Is it a plum-pudding cake?" said Lord JOHN. The rest
    laughed heartily. They loved their jokes, small and old.</p>

    <p>"Are we agreed?"</p>

    <p>"We are."</p>

    <p>"Have you anything to ask?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing. When do we start?"</p>

    <p>"We are on our way."</p>

    <p>"Shall we not melt as we approach?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly not."</p>

    <p>"How so?"</p>

    <p>"We shall have a constant frost."</p>

    <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

    <p>"Certain. I have taken in a supply of <i>Matinées</i>, and a
    stock of Five-act Tragedies."</p>

    <p>"Good. But how to raise the wind?"</p>

    <p>Scarcely, had the question been asked, when a frightful
    explosion shook the iceberg to its foundations. The Doctor
    rushed to the gasbag. It was empty. He frowned. Lord JOHN was
    smoking his pipe; the Colonel was turning over the pages of an
    old Algebra. He muttered to himself, "That ought to figure it
    out. If <i>x</i> = the amount of non-compressible fluid
    consumed by a given labourer in <i>y</i> days, find, by the
    substitution of poached eggs for kippered herrings, how many
    tea-cups it will take to make a transpontine hurricane. Yes,"
    he went on, "that's it. Yes, Sirree." And at these words the
    vast mass of congealed water rose majestically out of the
    ocean, and floated off into the nebular hypothesis. But the
    Philosopher had vanished.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <p>When the explosion narrated in the last chapter took place,
    the Philosopher had been looking out of the window. The shock
    had hurled him with the speed of a pirate 'bus through the air.
    Soon he became a speck. Shortly afterwards he reached a point
    in his flight situated exactly 40,000 miles over a London
    publisher's office. There was a short contest. Centrifugal and
    centripetal fought for the mastery, and the latter was
    victorious. The publisher was at home. The novel was accepted,
    and the Philosopher started to rejoin his comrades lost in the
    boundless tracts of space.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

    <p>"My faith," said Lord JOHN, "I am getting tired of this.
    Shall we never reach the Sun?"</p>

    <p>"Courage, my friend," was the well-known reply of the brave
    little Doctor. "We deviated from our course one hair's-breadth
    on the twelfth day. This is the fortieth day, and by the
    formula for the precession of the equinoxes, squared by the
    parallelogram of an ellipsoidal bath-bun fresh from the glass
    cylinder of a refreshment bar, we find that we are now
    travelling in a perpetual circle at a distance of one billion
    marine gasmeters from the Sun. I have now accounted for the
    milk in the cocoa-nut."</p>

    <p>"But not," said the Philosopher, as he popped up through a
    concealed trap-door, "for the hair outside. That remains for
    another volume." With that, he rang a gong. The iceberg
    splintered into a thousand pieces. The voyagers were each
    hurled violently down into their respective countries, where a
    savage public was waiting to devour them.</p>

    <h3>QUEER QUERIES.</h3>

    <p>DOMESTIC SERVICE.&mdash;My General Servant has just left me
    suddenly, on the ridiculous excuse that she was being "killed
    by overwork." She was not required to rise before 5 A.M., and
    she was generally in bed by twelve. Our house is not large,
    though rather lofty, and there are only fifteen in family. Of
    course I shall not pay her any wages, and shall retain her
    boxes; but how can I <i>really</i> punish her for her shameful
    desertion?&mdash;CONSIDERATE.</p>

    <p>HAIR FALLING OFF.&mdash;My hair is coming off, not slowly,
    but in one great circular patch at the top of the head. A
    malicious report has in consequence been spread abroad in the
    neighbourhood that I have been <i>scalped</i>! What course
    ought I to adopt to (1) recover damages against my traducers,
    and (2) recover my hair?&mdash;LITTLE WOOL.</p>

        respectability. Amidst a labyrinthine accumulation of

        "buyers," with lists and lead-pencils, on the look-out for
        "bargains," a sprinkling of the ancient race, and an outer
        fringe of casual, lounging, lookers-on. The gentleman in
        the rostrum is a voluble personage, with a rapidly roving
        eye, of preternatural quickness in picking up "bids."
        Attendants, shaggy men, in soiled shirt-sleeves, with
        saw-dusty whiskers, and husky voices. A pleasant-faced</i>
        Paterfamilias, <i>and his</i> "Good lady," <i>are
        discovered inspecting a solidly-built, well-seasoned,

    ma'ogany, every bit; the drawers run as smoothly as could be
    wished, and&mdash;see! if there ain't actually some sprigs of
    dry lavender still a laying in 'em!</p>

    <p><i>Paterfamilias</i> (<i>decidedly</i>). Just so, my dear, I
    shall certainly bid for them. [<i>Marks his catalogue

    Sold! Remove the first-class feather-bed, SAM. Buyer o'
    <i>that</i> has a bargain! (<i>Nodding blandly to pleased
    purchaser</i>). Really the prices at which things are going
    to-night are ruinous! 'Owever, there's no reserve, and the
    lucky public gets the pull. The next article, Ladies and Gents,
    No. 471, is a very superior, well-made, fully-seasoned, solid
    Spanish, ma'ogany chest of drawers. Chest o' drawers, SAM!
    (<i>To</i> Paterfamilias.) <i>Would</i> you mind standing a
    inch or so aside, Sir? Thanks! There they are, Ladies and
    Gentlemen, open to hinspection, and warranted to bear it. An
    unusually excellent lot, fit for the sleeping-apartment of a
    prince, at a price within the means of a pork-butcher.
    (<i>Laughter.</i>) Oh, it's righteous, Gents. No 'umbug about
    <i>me</i>. There's quality, if you like. Well worth a ten-pun
    note. What shall I have the pleasure of saying for this very
    superior article? 'Ow much for the chest o' drawers? Who bids
    for the ma'ogany chest? Thirty shillings. Thank you, Sir! Any
    advance on thirty shillings? Thirty-five! <i>And</i> six!
    Thirty-five-and-six for this very desirable little lot! Worth
    five times the amount, Ladies, as <i>you</i> know! What do you
    think. Mum? [<i>To</i> Materfamilias, <i>who smiles vaguely,
    and looks at her husband.</i></p>

    <p><i>Paterfamilias</i>. Two pounds! [<i>Feels he has made an

    <p><i>Auctioneer</i>. Two pounds! (<i>Confidentially to</i> P.)
    <i>Your</i> good lady knows a good bit o' stuff when she sees
    it, Sir! Two pounds for the chest! Two pounds! Any advance on a
    couple o' pounds? All done at two pounds? Going at two pounds!
    (<i>Meeting silence, pretends to hear another bid</i>).
    Two-pun-ten! Quite right, Sir! Very foolish to lose such a
    superior harticle for a pound or two. Going at two-pun-ten!
    Larst time, two-pun ten! Going&mdash;going&mdash;g&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Paterfamilias</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Two-fifteen!</p>

    <p><i>Auctioneer</i> (<i>cheerily</i>). Two-fifteen! (<i>Taking
    other imaginary bids</i>.) Three-pounds! Three-five! (<i>Thank
    you, Madam</i>). Three-ten! Going at three-ten! Last time,
    three-ten! (<i>To</i> Paterfamilias.) Are <i>you going to lose
    it, Sir?</i> Worth double, I assure you! Ask your good
    lady!</p>

    <p><i>Materfamilias</i> (<i>aside</i>). Bid three-fifteen,
    JOHN, but not a penny more!</p>

    <p><i>Paterfamilias</i> (<i>weakly</i>). Three-fifteen!</p>

    <p><i>Auctioneer</i>. Three-fifteen! Four! Going at four! Last
    time at four! All done, four! Going, going&mdash;gone!
    (<i>Drops hammer</i>.) Sold at four pounds, SAM! (<i>Looks
    round</i>.) Who bid four? [<i>No response, as the last bid was
    imaginary.</i></p>

    <p><i>Sam</i> (<i>huskily</i>). Gen'l'man as bid four jest
    slipped hout, Sir.</p>

        received contain "fresh shavings" instead of the "sprigs of
        blooming lavender" they had observed in those they thought
        they had purchased.</i> Paterfamilias, <i>a week later,

    <p>AUGUSTUS DRURIOLANUS is greater than ever. It is the
    penitential season of Lent; some excellent persons renounce all
    worldly amusements; others, not quite so excellent, and both
    lots thinking, it may be, no small beer of themselves, we may
    term the first lot Treble Excellent and the second Double
    Excellent&mdash;the latter division think that concerts
    possibly, sacred concerts certainly, and certain other forms of
    mild and non-theatrical entertainments, are of a sufficiently
    severe character to constitute, as it were, a form of
    discipline. Then there are the larger proportion of those
    "who," as <i>Mrs. Malaprop</i> would say, "'care for none of
    these things,' like GALILEO, my dear," and who inquire. "What
    is the state of the odds as long as we think we're happy?" and
    who would indulge in balls and theatres, and in every other
    form of amusement, while such pursuits afforded them, or
    seemed, to afford them, any pleasure. To the first section,
    <i>i.e.</i>, the "unco guid," DRURIOLANUS has nothing to offer,
    not even a course of sermons by popular preachers; but to the
    two others he has much to say. For these, last Saturday, he
    commenced the first of his series of Lenten Oratorios at Covent
    Garden&mdash;it was the 14th of February, and this was his
    Valentine&mdash;and on the 17th, <i>i.e.</i>, the Tuesday
    afterwards, having made, so to speak, a clean sweep of
    everything serious, out he comes with his Fancy Dress and
    Masked Ball. <i>Elijah</i> the Prophet, on Saturday, in the
    Covent Garden Calendar, must be reckoned among the "minor
    profits," seeing that the biggest profit would be found in the
    <i>Bal Masqué</i> on Tuesday. Over the doors should be the
    motto, "<i>Festina Lente</i>," whereof the Druriolanian
    translation must be, "Keep it up in Lent." <i>Ave Janus
    Druriolanus!</i></p>

    <h2>THE ETHICS OF MATCH-BOXES.</h2>

    <h4>BY COUNT DOLLSTOI.</h4>

    <h4>(<i>Intended for a Contemporary, but found to be too
    short.</i>)</h4>

    <h4>I.</h4>

    <p>What is the true explanation of the use which people make of
    matches&mdash;of safety matches, wooden matches, wax matches,
    and, less commonly, of fusees? Ask any man why he uses such
    things, and he will tell you that he does it to get a light, or
    because others do it.</p>

    <p>Is this true? You will probably think so. Let us examine the
    question. Why does a man hold his hand in front of a match when
    he lights it in the street? To screen it from the wind, or
    <i>to hide it from the sight of passers-by?</i> Why do ladies
    leave the dinner-table before the men begin to smoke? To avoid
    the smell of tobacco&mdash;which is well known to be aromatic,
    healthy, and delightful&mdash;or <i>because the natural modesty
    of women shrinks from witnessing the striking of a match?</i>
    Why, in a railway-carriage, do you hold your fusee out of
    window when you light it? Is it because you do not care about
    being half-choked&mdash;a paltry plea&mdash;or is it to conceal
    from young persons who may be in the carriage the sparkle which
    must inevitably remind them of wicked and alluring eyes?</p>

    <p>"<i>To get a light, or because others do it.</i>" Is that
    true? Do not trifle with the question. Read all my works. Do
    not get them from a contemptible circulating library, but buy
    them.</p>

    <h4>II.</h4>

    <p>Some may not yet be convinced that the striking of matches
    is suggestive and immoral. To me nearly everything is
    suggestive, but there are some stupid persons in England. I
    will be patient with them, and give them more evidence.</p>

    <p>A wax match is called a vesta. Who was Vesta? But this is
    too horrible. I cannot pursue this point in a periodical which
    is read in families. I can only refer you to the classical
    dictionary, and remind you that everything must infallibly
    suggest its opposite. Again, there are matches which strike
    <i>only</i> on the box. It distresses me to write these words.
    The idea of "onlyness," of restriction, must bring matrimony to
    the mind of everyone. If you do not know what I think about
    marriage, buy <i>The Kreutzer Sonata</i>. It is not customary
    to have more than one wife. Consequently, anything which has
    <i>one</i> in it&mdash;as, for instance, the date of WILLIAM
    THE CONQUEROR&mdash;reminds me of marriage, and is, therefore,
    degrading. Why, the very word "match" suggests marriage: and
    yet we allow young children to sell whole boxes of them in the
    streets. Horrible! Do you think our lower orders would become
    discontented, and strike, if they had not seen matches doing it
    first? Still more horrible!</p>

    <p>Finally, you strike a match that never struck you, that
    never offended you in any way. Is that just, or even manly?
    Yet, in nine cases out of ten, the law takes no notice of the
    offence.</p>

    <p>"<i>To get a light, or because others do it.</i>" Are you
    not convinced now that, when you use these words, you are not
    speaking the truth?</p>

    <h4>III.</h4>

    <p>I do not think I ever met anybody who was quite as moral, or
    quite as original, as I am. You should give a complete set of
    my works to each of your children. I might have generalised on
    the ill-effects of those vices from a special case&mdash;my own
    case. Had I done so, I could have got it printed. I can get
    anything printed that I write. I preferred to take a newer
    line, and to show you how vile you are when you use matches.
    Everything is vile. But you are wondering, perhaps, how a great
    novelist becomes a small faddist. You must wait till next
    month, and then read my article on the immorality of parting
    one's hair with a comb. A common table-fork is the only pure
    thing with which one can part one's hair. Combs deaden the
    conscience. But more of this anon.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>What is this the Baron reads in the <i>D.T.</i> of Feb. 9,
    and in the <i>Daily Graphic</i> of the same date? Here is a
    portion of the extract from the <i>D.T.</i>:&mdash;"The Monthly
    Meeting of that quaint Literary Society, 'Ye Odd Volumes,' at
    Limmer's Hotel, brought together not merely a goodly show of
    the Volumes themselves, but an unusually large array of
    visitors," and then follows the distinguished list, the
    crowning point being reached when we come to the name of "The
    Baron de BOOK-WORMS of <i>Punch</i>," and in the <i>Daily
    Graphic</i> the daring reporter goes a step farther, as, after
    giving the name of a certain honoured guest, he parenthetically
    explains that this academical <i>convive</i> is <i>the</i>
    "Baron de B.-W.!" <i>Erreur</i>! I, the Baron de B.-W., being
    of sound mind and body, hereby declare that <i>the Baron
    himself was not present</i>. And why? Well, do my readers
    remember the honest milk-maid's retort to the coxcomb who said
    he wouldn't marry her? Good. Then, substituting "me" for "you,"
    and "he" for "she," the Baron can adopt the maiden's reply.
    After this, other reasons would be superfluous.</p>

    <p>How came the reporter to fall into so great an error? Who
    misinformed him? A worthy henchman, as indignant as was <i>Sam
    Weller</i> when he found his beloved master's name trifled
    with, writes to ask me, "Ain't nobody to be whopped for takin'
    this here liberty, Sir?" With the immortal <i>Mr. Pickwick</i>,
    the Baron replies, "Certainly not. Not on any account." And,
    whatever that sturdy henchman may murmur to himself, he at once
    obeys. "Bring me my books!" cries the Baron, "I am off to the
    review."</p>

    <p>The Baron's Deputy writes, that he has again been steeping
    himself in poetry, and reports as follows:&mdash;<i>Ionica</i>
    (GEORGE ALLEN) is a little volume, which no admirer of true
    poetry should fail to possess. The author now calls himself W.
    CORY, but he was known by a different name to many generations
    of Etonians. His Muse generally wears a classical robe, but her
    speech is always delightfully musical. She has beautiful
    cadences, that haunt the memory like some old <i>Volkslied</i>.
    In spite of a careless confusion between "thou" and "you," I
    defy anybody to read "<i>Heraclitus</i>," to take only one
    instance, without a sense of pleasure which will compel him to
    learn the two verses by heart. But the Muse is pathetic,
    playful, and patriotic, too, when the occasion fits, and,
    whatever she sings, she sings with genuine taste and feeling.
    Would that we might hope for more of her pure music. So far the
    Deputy.</p>

    <p>Was that excentric character in <i>David Copperfield</i>
    nameless, who was represented as sitting in some sort of
    slop-shop, wheezing out fiercely, "O my lights and liver! O
    goroo, goroo!" I think DICKENS didn't give him a name, good or
    bad; but his constant repetition of the above outlandish
    exclamations has impressed upon him an awful and terrific
    personality, which places him among the more popular creations
    of Dickensian genius. Of what is this <i>à propos</i>? you will
    ask the Baron. "Well," he will make reply, "it is <i>à
    propos</i> of cookery books, and bookery cooks; the latter
    being those who are not above teaching themselves from the
    sacred books of Cookery, and who can put in practice the
    lessons they learn therein. Now," quoth the Baron, "let me
    recommend you to ask at CHAPMAN AND HALL's for <i>Hilda's
    'Where Is It' of Recipes</i>, a work got up as simply and
    substantially as a good dinner should be, with 'pages in
    waiting,' quite blank, all ready for your notes,&mdash;the
    book, like a dining-table, being appropriately interleaved; and
    there is, happy thought, a pencil in the cover-side most handy
    for the intending Lucullus." The season of Lent is an excellent
    one for cookery-books, because you can be studying for the
    dinner-giving season, and then&mdash;do not forget the
    generally excellent advice of your friend,</p>

    <h2>KING JOHN AT OXFORD.</h2>

    <p>The Oxford University Dramatic Society have acted another
    Shakspearian play with conspicuous success. To say that the
    O.U.D.S. have acted a play of SHAKSPEARE is to say nothing,
    seeing that they are compelled, under fear of the most dreadful
    punishments known to the University Calendar, to confine their
    histrionic efforts to the drama as SHAKSPEARE wrote it, with an
    occasional excursion into the dramatic verse of BROWNING. A
    great many, however, of the most influential members of the
    Hebdomadal Council are said to view any such departure from
    SHAKSPEARE with alarm, as calculated to impair the discipline
    and sap the morality of the tender nurselings confided to their
    charge, and it is doubtful if the experiment will be repeated.
    Long live the legitimate drama, say I, and so say all of us.
    But, after all, it may be questioned whether those who can
    listen unharmed to the broad, and, if I may say so,
    "illegitimate" humour of <i>Faulconbridge</i> in <i>King
    John</i> would take much damage from SHERIDAN, or LYTTON, or
    TOM TAYLOR, or even&mdash;though I make this particular
    suggestion with bated breath&mdash;from the performance of such
    burlesques as the A.D.C. at Cambridge from time to time offers
    to its patrons.</p>

    <p>All this is, however, by the way. We must take the O.U.D.S.
    as we find it, and I must confess I found it in a very strong
    and flourishing condition during the performance of <i>King
    John</i>. The audience is not an easy one to act to. Not that
    it errs on the side of over-criticism. Rather it is too
    painfully friendly and familiar with the actors. Here is a
    stray example culled from the Stalls:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Enter</i> King PHILIP, <i>the</i> DAUPHIN, <i>and
        attendant Knights.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Undergraduate in the Stalls</i> (<i>to his
    Neighbour</i>). Halloa! There's old Johnnie in chain armour and
    a helmet. Did you ever see such a rum 'un? Let's make him
    laugh.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>They do, and the unfortunate Knight infects his
        fellow Knights at a moment when a specially stern demeanour
        is required.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Or again, as here:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>The</i> DAUPHIN <i>places his arm round the waist of
        the</i> Lady BLANCH, <i>and conducts her to the back of the
        stage.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Voice in the Dress Circle</i>. Look out for the
    Proctor!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>General laughter.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>But in spite of these and similar exuberances, the play went
    well from first to last, and the enthusiasm of the audience was
    unbounded. It was stated on the programme that Mr. HENRY IRVING
    had lent the chain-mail and the tapestries. I have come to the
    conclusion that he lent himself as well, and then went and
    pretended he was his own son. At any rate, while Mr. HENRY
    IRVING (stated to be of New College) was declaiming as <i>King
    John</i>, I could have sworn that the impersonator of
    <i>Shylock</i> and <i>Macbeth</i> was walking the stage. Voice,
    gesture, and even mannerisms were there, toned down, of course,
    to suit the academic atmosphere, but manifest to all who know
    and love the great original. My hearty congratulations to the
    actor, whoever he was, on a most carefully studied and
    dignified rendering of his difficult part. Mr. ALAN MACKINNON,
    who grouped and arranged the whole of the play, was vigorous
    and spirited as <i>Faulconbridge</i>. He delivered his insults
    with immense force and go. The letter "<i>r</i>" is not an easy
    one for him to pronounce, but he struggled manfully with this
    obstacle, and after a time I got perfectly accustomed to the
    bold tones in which he ordered <i>Austria</i> to "hang a
    calf-skin chround those chrechreant limbs." <i>King
    Philip's</i> legs were, perhaps, too much inclined to
    independence, and never quite seemed to have made up their
    minds where they would settle down, but when once they were
    fixed the King was every inch a King. Little Miss MABEL HOARE
    made us all weep copiously as <i>Arthur</i>. I have kept
    <i>Hubert</i> to the last, in order to emphasise my opinion
    that Mr. CLARK, of New College, who acted this tender-hearted
    Chamberlain, carried off the chief honours of the performance.
    For consistent and restrained force, it would not have been
    easy to match Mr. CLARK's impersonation. Lady RADNOR's band was
    delightful, in light-blue and pink bows.</p>

    <p>The fight in the Second Act was tremendous. Never have I
    seen such dreadful blows delivered with such immense vigour on
    any other stage. A very polite French Knight who had taken part
    in the combat accorded me the honour of an interview
    afterwards. I congratulated him, and suggested that so
    realistic a battle must have been long and carefully rehearsed.
    "Rehearsals!" he laughed; "not a bit of it. We just lace into
    one another's heads as hard as we can lick." For the benefit of
    Mr. D'OYLY CARTE and other fighting managers I have given these
    admirable words as they were spoken.</p>

    <p>I had almost forgotten the ladies. There were three, Miss
    FFYTCHE, Mrs. CHARLES SIM, and Miss DOWSON, and they were all
    good&mdash;especially Mrs. SIM as <i>Constance</i>.</p>

    <p>And so farewell, for the present, to the O.U.D.S. and to
    Oxford. I may mention, by the way, that hospitality is as
    extensive and port wine as abundant as ever in the
    neighbourhood of the High. <i>Experto crede.</i> Yours to a
    turn, A VAGRANT.</p>

    <h2>THE PINK OF COURTESY, AND A TRUE BLUE.</h2>

    <p>Last week a Cambridge Graduate, a Layman, not a Reverend
    Don, kindly coached the Oxford Eight. The great Duke of
    WELLINGTON, courteously instructing the French Army how to
    defeat the English, would be an historical parallel. It is to
    be hoped that this sublime example of unselfish devotion to
    aquatic sport will be followed in other walks of life. We may
    expect to learn from the daily papers how,&mdash;</p>

    <p>On Monday a Cabinet Council was held at Downing Street. Lord
    SALISBURY presided, and Mr. W.H. SMITH being indisposed, Mr.
    W.E. GLADSTONE (at a moment's notice) kindly consented to take
    his place.</p>

    <p>On Tuesday General CAPRIVI went on leave, his place as
    confidential adviser to the Emperor of GERMANY being supplied
    during his absence by Prince Von BISMARCK.</p>

    <p>The Czar of RUSSIA, wishing to take a short holiday in
    Denmark, has arranged that his place shall be supplied by
    Prince ALEXANDER, once of Battenberg, and late of Bulgaria.
    Before his return to St. Petersburg His Majesty is likely to
    spend some time as the guest of several leading Nihilists.</p>

    <p>On Wednesday President CARNOT paid a long visit to General
    BOULANGER, with a view to submitting to that eminent statesman
    a scheme for the reorganisation of the French Army.</p>

    <p>On Thursday the King of ITALY, having arranged to accompany
    Signor CRISPI in a yachting cruise to South America, the POPE
    took up his residence at the Quirinal, and presided at a
    National Council. Later in the day his Holiness reviewed the
    Roman garrison.</p>

    <p>On Friday Mr. O'BRIEN gave a numerously attended "at home"
    in his new prison. Amongst those present were Mr. GLADSTONE,
    Lord SALISBURY, Mr. PARNELL, Mr. MCCARTHY, and Mr. TIM HEALY.
    It is understood that the result of this amicable meeting will
    be found in a spirit of reciprocity exhibited in the
    anti-Parnellites writing Mr. PARNELL's manifestoes for the
    Parnellites, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February 9</i>.&mdash;The
    ATTORNEY-GENERAL, with copy of Orders in his hand, casts
    reproachful, almost angry, glance on the harmless HOWORTH; that
    great diplomatist just dropped in from Arlington Street; been
    to see the MARKISS, and give him latest instructions as to
    conduct of public affairs, more especially with respect to
    Behring Sea, the Northampton Election, the Newfoundland
    Fisheries difficulty, and Assisted Education. A little fatigued
    with his exertions; doesn't observe WEBSTER's woful regard.</p>

             alt="Caustic Causton." /></a>Caustic Causton.
    </div>

    <p>"If it hadn't been for him," ATTORNEY-GENERAL mutters, still
    glaring on elect of Salford, "shouldn't have to be down here
    now, answering these sort of questions."</p>

    <p>No doubt HOWORTH was, though undesignedly, originator of the
    business. Saw in incident of Hartlepool election an opening for
    minimising effect. Wrapped purpose up in form of question
    addressed to ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Question in subtly diplomatic
    form insinuated against FURNESS charge of breach of Corrupt
    Practice Act. ATTORNEY-GENERAL, knowing that HOWORTH is the man
    who pulls the strings of statecraft, not only in Salford and
    London, but in Berlin and St. Petersburg, did not venture to
    decline to answer; gravely played up to his lead. Opposition
    laughed and cheered; saw their opening, and have since
    diligently filled it. Scarcely day passed since that questions
    on hypothetical cases, addressed to ATTORNEY-GENERAL, have not
    appeared on Orders. As they are moulded on HOWORTH's, which he
    answered fully, even genially, difficult to refuse reply. But
    there must be a limit to this kind of thing; reached to-day
    when caustic CAUSTON comes forward with request for gratuitous
    opinion on case submitted, involving difficult question of
    eligibility of Catholics for seat on Woolsack. SUMMERS, who,
    depressed by Irish domestic difficulty, hasn't put a question
    for three weeks, goaded into activity; puts down another on
    same subject. Mr. ATTORNEY respectfully declines to answer
    either. Opposition yell with derisive cheers.</p>

    <p>Mr. ATTORNEY a man of equable temper, but this too much for
    him. Must find object of attack somewhere. Waited till HOWORTH
    had said adieu to five ladies whom he had been showing round
    the House. "Look here, HOWORTH," said Mr. ATTORNEY, his amiable
    visage clouded with unwonted wrath, "you content yourself with
    looking after the MARKISS, and keeping him straight, but don't
    you come round me any more with your confoundedly clever
    questions."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Tithe Bill still on Report
    stage.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Met JOHN MORLEY in corridor just now
    walking along with long stride and troubled countenance.
    "What's the matter?" I asked. "Is the French Revolution still
    troubling you, or are you in fresh difficulties On
    Compromise?"</p>

    <p>"No, dear TOBY," he said; "like MARTHA, I am troubled with
    none of these things. The fact is, I am pining for opportunity
    to give battle to BALFOUR in the matter of his Government of
    Ireland. You remember I tabled notice of a Motion on the matter
    as soon as the House met in November. Then I was so anxious, so
    absorbed in the subject, that I forgot all about it till Brer
    FOX and Brer RABBIT appeared on the scene, and bid against each
    other for precedence. Thereupon I pulled my Resolution out of
    pigeon-hole; reminded OLD MORALITY of my prior claim; had it
    admitted, and day fixed. Should have come on last Monday, you
    know. Tithes Bill in hand all last week; everybody tired of it;
    agree there's really nothing in it; Opposition smouldering out;
    then suddenly, my Motion having been put down for Monday,
    interest in Tithes Bill swells; becomes absorbing. Couldn't
    possibly finish last Thursday; everyone so urgent to continue
    debate that House was Counted Out on Friday; yesterday was
    appropriated for further debate on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
       id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span> Report stage; Thursday next
       is taken for Third Reading, and I'm put off till
       Monday."</p>

    <p>"And who arranged all this?" I asked, with unfeigned
    sympathy.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:15%;">
        <a href="images/96-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/96-1.png"
             alt="Walking it Off." /></a>Walking it Off.
    </div>

    <p>"Well, it was our fellows, you know, with assistance of
    Irish Members. We are all so anxious to have it out with Prince
    ARTHUR that we made it impossible for debate on his iniquities
    to come on this week. TIM HEALY suddenly developed personal
    interest in Tithes Bill. Put down several new Clauses. So
    succeeded in perhaps indefinitely deferring debate on my
    Resolution. You know little, TOBY, of the thirst for battle.
    It's more exhausting than the conflict itself. You'll excuse
    me, I'll take another turn; to walk off the restless excitement
    is the only hope left for me."</p>

    <p>And crossing his hands behind him, honest JOHN was off
    again, down the corridor, his red necktie gleaming in the
    further recesses like the lurid light of battle.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Tithes Bill through Report
    stage.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Marriage with Deceased Wife's Sister
    Bill on again. A hardy annual, carefully cultured in Commons,
    and regularly nipped in Lords. The speeches to-day naturally
    did not present any features riotously novel. HALL of Oxford
    (not the University, but the Brewery) seconded Motion for
    rejection of Bill. A beautiful speech, I thought, full of
    touching sentiments, delivered with much unction. His plea for
    the sanctity of sisterhood brought tears into eyes unused to
    excessive moisture. Didn't seem to have much to do with the
    Bill, but very touching.</p>

    <p>"Like evening bells," I said to the Member for Sark.</p>

    <p>"More like a barrel-organ," he responded, gruffly. "HALL has
    the oratorical manner of a street-preacher, and the emptiness
    of a tankard that a thirsty porter has held to his lips for
    sixty seconds. Like a skilfully-drawn glass of his own
    four-half, he's mostly froth; only, after all, there's
    something under the froth in the glass of 'HALL's Hextra,' and
    there's nothing beneath the sound of HALL's ambitious
    common-places."</p>

        </a>Hirsute Hints for Lord Randolph; or, the Art of
        Political Make-up.
    </div>

    <p>SARK often says nasty things; seems in particularly
    disagreeable mood to-day. Even fell foul of the inoffensive
    Member for Crewe. WALTER MCLAREN, whilst declaring himself
    strongly in favour of Bill, wanted to throw it out because it
    didn't provide opportunity for women to marry their deceased
    husband's brother.</p>

    <p>"McLAREN," snarled SARK, "is one of those typical Radicals
    who have no toleration. He's the sort of man who would bite off
    his nose to spite his face. Quiet, gentle, almost feminine, in
    his manner, he would think nothing of boiling you and me in
    molten lead if we didn't cross our t's exactly at the height he
    is accustomed to do, or dotted our i's at an angle which did
    not conform with his views. Scratch a Radical, TOBY my boy, and
    you'll find the Tyrant."</p>

    <p>I'll take care to do no such thing.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Deceased Wife's Sister Bill read
    Second Time by 202 Votes against 155.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;After long period of anxiety, House
    to-night reassured. GEDGE, who hasn't been seen since he
    disappeared after obstructing passage through Committee of
    Tithes Bill, turned up again. Curiously regarded by House;
    looked for signs of privation, but no falling off visible,
    whether in physical contour or volume of voice. Tithes Bill
    during his absence has gone through Committee and Report stage.
    Now awaiting Third Reading. GEDGE proposed to continue his
    speech interrupted by stroke of Midnight, when House in
    Committee. Fixed himself obligingly behind GOSCHEN and
    HICKS-BEACH, so that they should miss nothing of his counsel,
    and started off. Instantly arose stormy cries for Division.
    GEDGE, wherever he has been, seems to have been well-fed, and
    kept generally in good fettle. Cheerfully accepted challenge to
    vocal contest. Every time he commenced sentence the boisterous
    chorus, "'vide! 'vide! 'vide!" rang though House. Opposition,
    who didn't want Bill, started it; Ministerialists, anxious to
    see Bill pass, took it up; a roaring, excited crowd; amid them
    GEDGE, grey-faced, imperturbable, with mouth wide open,
    shouting in the ear of the pleased CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.
    <i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Tithes Bill read Third Time by 250
    Votes against 161.</p>

    <div class="figright"

    </div>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;The United Services come nobly to the
    front to-day, all about Nelson's Pillar in Sackville Street,
    Dublin. However it may be at Westminster, Irish Members can't
    abear obstruction at home; brought in Bill to remove Monument
    lower down street; long debate; towards close Admiral FIELD
    suddenly hove in sight; bore down on enemy.</p>

    <p>"As humble naval officer," he roared, as through a
    speaking-trumpet, "I protest against addressing our immortal
    naval hero in the words of the Poet, saying unto him, 'Friend,
    go down lower.'"</p>

    <p>General FRASER, V.C., sitting next to Admiral on Front Bench
    below the Gangway; bosom swelled with generous emulation; Navy
    attacked; duty of Army to come to its assistance. General
    doesn't often speak; appearances as public orator chiefly
    confined to responding to patriotic toast at dinners. This led
    him a little astray. Drawing himself up to full height, setting
    hands on hips, he began, in deep bass voice, "In rising to
    respond to this toast&mdash;" Then, remembering where he was,
    he executed strategic retreat, and addressed himself to
    SPEAKER.</p>

    <p>Spectacle of the two veterans defending memory of NELSON
    deeply touched House. Nevertheless, Bill carried. <i>Business
    done</i>.&mdash;Counted Out at Half-past Seven.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>IN MONTAGU WILLIAMS' <i>Later Leaves</i> there is a small
    error, but of importance to the historian of the English Stage,
    which can be corrected in the next edition:&mdash;Mr. KEELEY
    never played <i>Bob Mettles</i>, and there is no such character
    in TOM TAYLOR's <i>Our Clerks. Bob Nettles</i> is one of the
    principal characters in <i>To Parents and Guardians</i>, and it
    was played by Mrs. KEELEY, her husband playing
    <i>Waddilove</i>. Middle-aged play-goers will remember both
    pieces; and in the latter, no one will forget ALFRED WIGAN as
    the French Tutor.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>CIVIL SERVICE NOTE.&mdash;The Directors of the Covent Garden
    Opera Company present their compliments to the C.S. Examiners,
    and trust that they will reconsider their determination to

    during the forthcoming Opera season. Box Office now open.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
